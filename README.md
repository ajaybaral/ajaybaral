### üßë‚Äçüíª About Me

My name is **Ajay Baral**, and my journey into programming began with a simple curiosity that has since grown into a deep passion. I am currently pursuing a **Bachelor‚Äôs in Computer Engineering** at the **University of Mumbai** with a **CGPA of 9.13**.

I have gained valuable experience as a **Software Development Intern at Purpose Buddy**, where I contributed to automation projects, particularly on CRMs. Additionally, I worked as a **Full Stack Intern at Foofin Innovation**, developing an E-Commerce full-stack website and optimizing API testing workflows.

Beyond academics and work, I actively **participate in hackathons and contests** to challenge myself and foster continuous growth. Having solved **250+ Data Structures and Algorithms problems**, I am committed to continuous learning and making a meaningful impact in the tech industry.
